      question: "What problems are you solving for shoppers?",
      answer:
      "Online shopping is isolating, artificial, and oftentimes just boring. It doesn't come close to replicating the in-person shopping experience with natural conversation with friends/brand representatives, spontaneous product discovery, and trying on clothes."
    },
    {
      question: "And for clothing manufacturers?",
      answer:
      "Attracting high-intent customers to a brand's platform is very fragmented, inefficient, and expensive. Once potential customers are 'in the door', many clothing brands struggle to create meaningful relationships and experiences with their customers online, only to be exasperated by COVID-19."
    },
    {
      question: "How are you solving these problems?",
      answer:
      "We are creating an all encompassing mobile shopping experience for users to replicate the best aspects of shopping in-person. Namely, 1) interacting with friends (conversing, sharing/recommending clothes); 2) engaging with and receiving support from brand representatives; 3) seeing how clothes look on you before you purchase; 4) discovering new items spontaneously from other users."
    },
    {
      question: "Why now?",
      answer:
      "Malls and clothing stores are progressively shutting down while ecommerce has been taking a great share of the US retail market, drastically accelerated by COVID-19. Many of these brands aren't ready for the shift to a digital-first presence â€” how to engage with customers besides website, social media, and email? Many shoppers don't feel comfortable shopping in-person, especially trying-on clothes. We aim to help clothing brands improve their online presence and reimagine the online shopping experience for users. Along with some hardware and software improvements in recent years, we believe that this is the best time to launch."
